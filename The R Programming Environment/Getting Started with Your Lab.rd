    \item swirl is a package which teaches R programming and Data Science interactively.
    \item Load the library using library(swirl).
    \item library(swirl)
    \item swirl::install_course()
    \item Select “The_R_Programming_Environment.swc” when prompted
    \item swirl()
    \item Enter your name when prompted
    \item Return until you are asked to select, 1, 2 or3

    \item You are then ready to complete the assignment in the
    same way you would on your local machine (as per the instructions \cr
    provided in the course Coursera shell).\cr
    \item To receive credit for your work within the Coursera shell, \cr
    follow the prompts at the end of the swirl lesson using the email \cr
    connected to your Coursera account, and a token you generate \cr
    in the appropriate assignment page in course Coursera shell.\cr

\section{Using Provided Datasets}{
Throughout this course, you'll encounter datasets which are hosted on other websites. If you'd like to complete your work in the lab sandbox environment, please download these datasets from their listed websites and upload the data files directly into your RStudio lab environment. Lab Sandboxes have limited access to external sites, so uploading your data files directly will help ensure you do not hit any access errors.
} 

\section{Using Github in this Sandbox}{
You can perform basic HTTPS Github commands, such as git clone in this sandbox without any additional setup. If you choose to link your sandbox for version control, please note that you'll want to link your Github to your RStudio Sandbox lab first. This can be done in the Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN settings. You'll want to create an RSA key in these settings as well.
